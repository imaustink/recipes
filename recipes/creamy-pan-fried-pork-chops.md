2. Austin's Seasoning
3. 1 cup of flour
4. 2 tablespoons of butter
5. 2 tablespoons of olive oil
6. 2 tablespoons of minced garlic
7. 2 tablespoons of flour
8. 1/2 cup of chicken broth
9. 1 cup of heavy whipping cream
10. 1 teaspoon of chicken bouillon

## Directions

2. In a container, combine 1 cup of flour with Austin's Seasoning.
3. Dredge the pork chops in the flour mixture, ensuring they are well coated on both sides.
4. Heat a skillet over medium heat and add the butter and olive oil, allowing them to melt together.
5. Place the pork chops in the skillet and fry for about 4 to 5 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and reach an internal temperature of at least 145°F.
6. Remove the pork chops from the skillet and set them aside.
7. Lower the heat and add the minced garlic to the skillet, stirring to avoid burning.
8. Add 2 tablespoons of flour to the skillet and stir to form a roux.
9. Gradually add the chicken broth, heavy cream, chicken bouillon, and additional salt to taste, stirring continuously until the sauce thickens.
10. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper, and 1 teaspoon each of paprika and onion powder.
11. Once the sauce is smooth and creamy, pour it over the pork chops and serve.

## Tips

1. Ensure the pork chops are cooked to an internal temperature of at least 145°F for safety.
