# Homemade Flatbread Pizzas

## Ingredients

* 1 tsp active dry or instant yeast
* 1 tsp granulated sugar
* 3/4 cup warm water (between 100-110 degrees)
* 2 cups all-purpose or bread flour + more for hands and surface
* 1 tbsp olive oil + 1 tsp to brush the dough with
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tsp Italian seasoning

## Directions

* Place the yeast and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment 
* Por warm water on top and whisk gently to combine, then loosely cover with a kitchen towel and sit for 5 minutes (the mix should be frothy after 5 mins)
* With the stand mixer running on low speed, add the flour, olive oil, salt, garlic and Italian seasoning 
* Beat on low speed for 1 minute (the dough should be thick and shaggy). Transfer it to a lightly floured surface, including any loose flour
* Knead it with lightly floured hands for 2 mins, until it comes together and is smooth (if too sticky, add 1-2 tbsp of flour) 
* Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Allow to sit and rest for 45 mins at room temperature
* Once it has rested and has slightly risen, you can place it in the fridge up to 2 days
* As the dough is resting and rising, preheat oven to 475 degrees and prepare toppings. I recommend a base of olive oil + minced garlic + seasonings, then top with a drained can of artichokes, spinach, sun dried tomatoes, grape tomatoes, basil and mozzarella pearls
* Shape the dough by punching it to release any air. Divide the dough into two and on a lightly floured surface and stretch out until its about 1/4‚Äù thick
* Transfer dough onto parchment paper and pike holes with a form. Drizzle olive oil base/sauce base and top
* Bake 15-20 minutes or until the crust and toppings are browned
