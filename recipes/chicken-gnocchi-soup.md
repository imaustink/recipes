## Directions

1. Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add diced onion, celery, and carrots. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 7â€“9 minutes until the vegetables are tender. Add minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds, stirring constantly.  
2. Add salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, chicken bouillon, parsley, oregano, and thyme. Stir for 15 seconds to combine. Add the butter and stir until it melts.  
3. Sprinkle flour over vegetables and whisk constantly for 1 minute. Gradually pour in the chicken broth, continuing to whisk until smooth and slightly thickened. Add the milk and cream. Bring the mixture to a boil.
