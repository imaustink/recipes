## Ingredients

1. 1½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
2. 1 teaspoon kosher salt
3. ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
4. 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
5. 4 tablespoons olive oil (divided)
6. ½ onion (chopped)
7. 4 cloves garlic (minced)
8. ⅔ cup sun-dried tomatoes (chopped)
9. 1½ cups orzo
10. 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth
11. 3 cups fresh spinach

13. ¼ cup grated parmesan cheese

For Serving (optional):

## Directions

1. Season the chicken thighs with kosher salt, ground black pepper, and Italian seasoning.
2. In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat.
3. Once heated, add the chicken thighs, cooking for 3-4 minutes on each side until browned.
4. Remove the chicken from the pan and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
5. Add the chopped onion, sprinkle with salt, and cook for a couple of minutes until softened.
6. Add the minced garlic and sun-dried tomatoes. Cook for another minute.
7. Stir in the orzo.
8. Add the chicken broth and bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.
9. Place the chicken thighs back in the pan.
10. Cover the pan and simmer for 10-15 minutes until the orzo is cooked.
11. Remove the chicken thighs from the pan once again.
12. Stir in the fresh spinach, heavy cream, and grated parmesan cheese.
13. Return the chicken thighs to the pan.
14. Finish with a sprinkle of chopped fresh parsley, more parmesan cheese, and a squeeze of lemon juice.

## Equipment

1. Cast Iron Skillet

## Tips

- I recommend using a cast iron skillet because it holds and distributes heat really well. However, you can use another non-stick skillet instead.
- Browning the chicken thighs first helps ensure they cook through fully with the orzo later in the recipe.
- Toasting the orzo for a couple of minutes in the pan before adding broth will give it a nuttier, more flavorful finish.
- Cover the pan while the orzo is simmering to help it absorb the liquid and cook through properly.
- Fully cooked chicken thighs should reach an internal temp of 165-175 degrees F.
- Store Tuscan chicken and orzo in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 4 days.
