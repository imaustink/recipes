# Cube Steak

## Ingredients

1. **Cube Steaks**
   - 4 cube steaks
   - 3 Tablespoons flour
   - 2 Tablespoons olive oil
   - 3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, separated

2. **Meat Seasoning**
   - 1 teaspoon brown sugar
   - 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
   - ½ teaspoon salt
   - ½ teaspoon garlic powder
   - ½ teaspoon onion powder
   - ½ teaspoon chili powder
   - ½ teaspoon paprika

3. **Gravy**
   - 2 tablespoons cornstarch
   - 1 cup chicken broth
   - 1 cup beef broth
   - 1 beef bouillon cube, or 1 tsp better than bouillon
   - 1 teaspoon onion powder
   - ½ teaspoon garlic powder
   - 1 ½ teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
   - 1 large yellow onion, sliced into ½ inch strings

## Directions

1. **Seasoning Prep:** Combine the meat seasoning mix and set aside.
2. **Gravy Prep:** Combine the cornstarch and chicken/beef broth in a medium bowl and whisk until incorporated and smooth. Whisk in 1 beef bouillon cube, 1 tsp onion powder, ½ tsp garlic powder and 1 ½ tsp Worcestershire sauce. Set aside.
3. **Meat Prep:** Place saran wrap over each cube steak and use the rough end of a meat tenderizer to pound it thin, about ½ inch thick or so. Pat the steaks completely dry. Rub seasoning mix on each side of the steak, then rub with flour. Tap off excess flour.
4. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear 2 steaks at a time for about 3 minutes per side. Set steaks on a plate to rest.
5. Leave the meat flecks in the pan. Melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat and use a silicone spatula to ‘clean’ the bottom of the pan. Add the onions and toss to coat. Cook the onions for 15-25 minutes, until desired consistency is obtained.
6. Add the liquid gravy mixture and use a silicone spatula to clean the bottom and sides of the pan once again. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.
7. Add the steaks and any juices back to the pan and spoon some gravy on the top of each steak. Simmer with the lid partially covered for 5 minutes or so, until the gravy is thickened and the meat is cooked to your liking.
8. Optional: Remove from heat and melt 2 Tablespoons cold butter at the end for a silky, velvety finish.
9. Serve with mashed potatoes, buttermilk biscuits, and roasted carrots or green beans.

## Equipment

1. Meat Tenderizer
2. Silicone Spatula
3. Deep 13-inch skillet
4. Meat Thermometer
5. 1/2 cup Rubbermaid containers with lids
6. Magnetic Measuring Spoons

## Tips

1. Aim for an internal temperature of 125° for tender results. It will increase an additional 5° after it's removed from the heat.
2. The gravy recipe uses a combination of beef and chicken broth for depth of flavor, but all beef broth may be used.
3. Onions can be omitted if preferred, or mushrooms can be used instead.
4. A cast iron skillet will give your steaks a nice crusty sear.
5. Cornbread makes a great side dish with this meal.
