# Stuffed Pepper Casserole

## Ingredients

1. 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
2. 1 pound ground beef
3. 1 medium yellow onion
4. 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
5. 2 teaspoons ground cumin
6. 1 teaspoon kosher salt
7. ½ teaspoon ground pepper
8. 3 cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon)
9. A few handfuls of fresh spinach
10. 1.5–2 red bell peppers, cored and finely diced
11. 2 cups water
12. 1 can (15-ounces) fire-roasted diced tomatoes in their juices
13. 1 8-ounce can no-salt-added tomato sauce
14. 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
15. 1 cup uncooked brown rice, rinsed and drained
16. ½ cup shredded cheddar cheese
17. For serving: chopped fresh cilantro or parsley; Greek yogurt

## Directions

1. In a Dutch oven or similar deep, sturdy pot, heat the oil over medium-high. Add the ground beef and onion. With a wooden spoon or spatula, break the meat into small pieces. Cook and stir until it is browned and fully cooked through and the onion is tender, about 7 minutes.
2. Add the Italian seasoning, cumin, salt, pepper, and garlic. Stir and cook until the garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the fresh spinach. With a fork (or very carefully with your fingers) break apart the clumps so it's fairly evenly distributed with the meat. Add the red bell peppers, water, tomatoes, tomato sauce, Worcestershire, and rice. Stir to evenly combine.
3. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover the pot and let cook for 30 minutes. Uncover and stir, scraping up any rice that is beginning to stick. Recover and continue to simmer until the rice is tender, about 10 to 15 additional minutes.
4. Remove the pot from the heat. Uncover and stir. Taste and adjust the seasoning as desired. Don’t worry if it’s still a little liquidy. It will continue to thicken and the liquid will further absorb as it sits. Sprinkle the cheese over the top, then recover.
5. Let sit off the heat for 10 minutes, until the cheese is melted, the rice is tender (it will still have a little bit of chew, which is normal for brown rice, but it should not be crunchy). If you’d like the top golden, place the dish, uncovered, under the broiler for a minute or two (watch carefully to ensure the top does not burn). Serve warm, sprinkled with fresh cilantro or parsley.
