# Brown Sugar Balsamic Pork Tenderloin Recipe – Perfectly Glazed

## Ingredients

1. 1–2 pork tenderloins (about 1.5–2 pounds total), trimmed of silver skin
2. 1/4 cup brown sugar
3. 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
4. 2 cloves garlic, minced
5. 2 tablespoons olive oil
6. 1 tablespoon soy sauce
7. 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard (optional)
8. Salt, to taste
9. Freshly cracked black pepper, to taste

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Trim any silver skin off the pork tenderloin.
2. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together brown sugar, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, soy sauce, minced garlic, and Dijon mustard (if using).
3. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add a drizzle of olive oil. Sear the pork tenderloin for about 2-3 minutes per side until golden brown.
4. Pour half of the glaze over the pork in the skillet, turning it to coat evenly. Reserve the other half for basting later.
5. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven (or move the pork to a baking dish if needed). Roast for 20-25 minutes, basting with the remaining glaze halfway through.
6. Use a meat thermometer to check for doneness—145°F (63°C) in the thickest part means it’s perfect. Remove from the oven and let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing.
7. Slice the pork into medallions and drizzle with any extra glaze from the skillet. Serve and enjoy.

## Equipment

1. Large Skillet: For searing the pork before glazing. Cast iron works best, but any oven-safe skillet will do.
2. Oven: Preheated to 375°F (190°C). This recipe finishes in the oven for that perfect caramelization.
3. Tongs: Makes turning the pork easy during searing.
4. Mixing Bowl: For combining the glaze ingredients.
5. Measuring Cups and Spoons: Precision matters here, especially for the glaze.

## Tips

1. Sear the pork first to lock in juices and create a golden crust.
2. Use a meat thermometer to ensure the pork is cooked to 145°F (63°C).
3. Let the pork rest for 5-10 minutes after cooking to keep it juicy.
4. Double the glaze recipe if serving a crowd.
