# Chicken Tortellini Soup (Slow Cooker)

## Ingredients

1. 1 onion, diced
2. 3 medium carrots, peeled, halved, and sliced
3. 3 stalks celery, sliced
4. 1 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts
5. 1 teaspoon minced garlic
6. 3/4 teaspoon salt
7. 1/2 teaspoon pepper
8. 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
9. 1 teaspoon dried parsley
10. 6 cups chicken broth
11. 1 9-ounce package cheese tortellini
12. Optional: chopped fresh parsley for garnish

## Directions

1. Place the onion, carrots, celery, chicken breasts, garlic, salt, pepper, thyme, parsley, and chicken broth in a slow cooker.
2. Cook for 3-4 hours on HIGH or 6-8 hours on LOW.
3. Remove the chicken breasts and shred with two forks, then return to the soup.
4. Add the tortellini to the slow cooker and cook for 10-15 minutes more or until they are puffy and heated through.
5. Serve, garnished with parsley if desired.

## Equipment

1. Slow cooker
2. Knife
3. Cutting board
4. Measuring spoons
5. Ladle
6. Forks for shredding chicken

## Tips

1. Use fresh cheese tortellini for faster cooking. If using frozen, add an additional 10 minutes to the cook time.
2. Cut vegetables into larger pieces to prevent them from becoming overly soft.
3. Store soup in the fridge for up to 3 days. Add more broth when reheating as the pasta absorbs liquid.
4. Prepare vegetables the night before to save time in the morning.
5. For stove top preparation, sauté vegetables in butter, add diced raw chicken, broth, and seasonings, cook for 20 minutes, then add tortellini and simmer until tender.
