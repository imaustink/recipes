# Lemon Chicken Orzo Soup

## Ingredients

1. 2 sticks celery, chopped finely
2. 2 medium carrots, peeled & chopped finely
3. 1/2 medium onion, chopped
4. 1 tablespoon butter
5. 1 tablespoon olive oil
6. 3 cloves garlic, minced
7. 2 tablespoons flour
8. 6 cups chicken broth
9. 1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning
10. 1.5 pounds uncooked chicken breasts
11. 1 cup uncooked orzo
12. 1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste
13. 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste
14. Salt & pepper, to taste

## Directions

1. Sauté the celery, carrots, and onions in a large soup pot with the butter and oil over medium-high heat for 5-7 minutes.
2. Stir in the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds, then add the flour and cook for another minute or so.
3. Pour in the chicken broth and stir until the flour has dissolved, then add the Italian seasoning and chicken. Bring the soup to a boil.
4. Cover the soup (lid slightly open), and reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.
5. Stir in the orzo and cook for another 10 minutes or until the orzo is cooked through. I keep the lid off and stir it fairly often because it tends to stick to the bottom of the pot.
6. Take the chicken out of the pot and cut it up, then add it back in. Add the lemon juice, parsley, and season the soup with salt & pepper as needed. Serve immediately.

## Equipment

1. Large soup pot or Dutch oven
2. Knife
3. Cutting board
4. Garlic press (optional)
5. Airtight pantry container (optional)
6. Microplane zester/grater (optional)

## Tips

1. You can substitute the chicken breasts for chicken thighs if you prefer.
2. Use low-sodium chicken broth if you’re sensitive to salt.
3. You may need to add more chicken broth to leftovers as the orzo soaks it up.
4. If you want a more intense lemon flavor, consider adding lemon zest.
