#### Ingredients

1. 1 Butterball turkey breast (thawed)
2. 1 can whole berry cranberry sauce
3. 1 packet onion soup & dip mix
4. 1/4 cup orange juice
5. 1/2 cup apple cider
6. 1 tsp poultry seasoning
7. Fresh rosemary and thyme (optional)

#### Directions

4. Pour the mixture over the turkey breast in the crock pot.
5. Add fresh rosemary and thyme if desired.
6. Cover and cook on low for 5-7 hours or on high for 3-4 hours, until the turkey reaches an internal temperature of 165°F.
