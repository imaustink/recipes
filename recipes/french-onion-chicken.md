3. Serve in a shallow bowl or on a plate and then spoon the French Onion Chicken on top.

## Tips

- Don’t skip on pre-seasoning the chicken. Seasoning meat properly is essential.
- Stir the onions continuously for true caramelization flavor.
- Use beef stock instead of broth for better flavor and consistency.
- Use 8 oz. of the Gruyere cheese for optimal taste.
- Use fresh herbs where required.
- Choose the best extra virgin olive oil available.
- Use sea salt and fresh cracked pepper, not table salt.
- A large Dutch oven or pan is ideal for this one-pot recipe.
- Pair with Red Skinned Mashed Potatoes or Green Beans with almonds if desired.
