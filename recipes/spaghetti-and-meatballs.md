6. 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
7. 4 cloves garlic, minced
8. 1/4 cup chopped parsley (or 2 tsp dried)
9. 1 tsp dried oregano
10. 1 tsp black pepper
11. 3 tsp kosher salt (reduce to 2–2.5 tsp if using table salt)
12. Optional: 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, 1 tsp fennel seed (lightly crushed)

### Tomato Sauce

2. 1 medium onion, finely chopped

4. 2 tbsp olive oil
5. 3 oz canned tomato sauce
6. 1 cup dry red wine (e.g., Chianti or Cabernet)
7. 1 tsp dried oregano
8. Salt and pepper to taste
9. Pinch of sugar (if needed)
10. Fresh basil (a handful, torn — optional)
11. Optional: 1 tbsp tomato paste for extra richness

### Pasta

1. 1 lb spaghetti
2. Salt for pasta water
3. Reserved 1/2 cup pasta water

## Directions

### Meatballs

1. Mix breadcrumbs and milk in a large bowl. Let sit 2 minutes.
2. Add all remaining meatball ingredients. Mix gently until just combined.
3. Form into ~1.5 inch balls (~20–24 total).
4. Optional: Brown meatballs in olive oil or bake at 425°F for 15–18 minutes.

### Tomato Sauce

1. In a large pot, heat olive oil. Sauté onion until soft (5—7 min).
2. Add garlic and cook ~1 min until fragrant.
3. Stir in tomato sauce. Cook for 2—3 minutes to deepen flavor and reduce rawness.
4. Add red wine and simmer until reduced by half (5—7 min).
5. Stir in crushed San Marzano tomatoes, oregano, salt, and pepper. Add tomato paste if using.
6. Gently add meatballs. Simmer partially covered for 30—45 minutes.
7. Add torn basil at the end, and adjust seasoning to taste.

### Pasta

1. Cook 1 lb spaghetti in well-salted water until al dente.
2. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water.
3. Toss pasta with a bit of sauce.
4. Serve with meatballs, more sauce, grated Parmesan, and fresh herbs.

## Equipment

1. Large bowl
2. Large pot
3. Baking sheet (if baking meatballs)
4. Skillet (if browning meatballs)
5. Pot for cooking pasta
6. Colander

## Tips

1. Adjust the salt in the meatballs if using table salt instead of kosher salt.
2. Browning the meatballs adds extra flavor but is optional.
3. Add a pinch of sugar to the sauce if the tomatoes are too acidic.
4. Use fresh basil for a burst of flavor at the end of cooking.
