# 30-Minute Bruschetta Chicken (Grilled or Baked)

## Ingredients

### Chicken
1. 4 6-oz boneless skinless chicken breasts
2. 2 teaspoon Italian seasoning
3. 1 teaspoon kosher salt
4. 1 teaspoon onion powder
5. 1 teaspoon garlic powder
6. 1 teaspoon ground pepper
7. 1-2 tablespoon olive oil

### Bruschetta
1. 3-4 medium ripe tomatoes (about 1 lb), cored, seeded, and chopped to a ½” dice
2. 1 teaspoon kosher salt
3. 2 cloves garlic, minced
4. 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
5. 2 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
6. 2 tablespoon thinly sliced basil leaves
7. Ground pepper, to taste
8. Balsamic glaze, to taste, optional

## Directions

1. **Start the bruschetta.** Combine the chopped tomatoes with salt and garlic in a mixing bowl; mix until well combined, then let sit while the chicken cooks.
2. **Prepare the chicken.** Place one chicken breast onto a sheet of parchment paper. Fold the paper over the chicken. Using a rolling pin, pound the chicken breast to an even thickness of a little less than 1". Set aside and repeat with the remaining chicken breasts.
3. Combine the Italian seasoning, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper in a small bowl. Stir to combine.
4. Brush the chicken with olive oil, then sprinkle with the seasoning blend. Flip the chicken over, then oil and season the other side.
5. **To Grill:** Heat a grill or grill pan over high heat. Place the chicken breasts directly on the grill grates and cook 5-6 minutes per side, or until the internal temperature reads 165°F using an instant read thermometer. Remove from the grill and rest 5 minutes.
6. **To Bake:** Heat the oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roast the chicken for 10-12 minutes, or until the internal temperature reads 165°F using an instant read thermometer. Remove from the oven and rest five minutes.
7. **Finish the bruschetta topping.** Stir in the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, fresh basil, and ground pepper to taste. Taste for seasoning and adjust with salt, pepper, or vinegar to taste.
8. Top the grilled chicken with the bruschetta. Serve immediately.

## Tips

### Chef’s Tips

- **Pound the chicken to even thickness.** This will both tenderize the chicken and ensure even cooking throughout.
- Properly preheat the grill. If you have a thermometer gauge on your grill, wait for it to reach 425-450°F.
- **Always check the internal temperature** using an instant read thermometer – the chicken should reach 165°F before you remove it from the grill or oven.
- **Rest five minutes** to allow the juices to settle.
- **Add cheese!** Add 4 ounces of fresh mozzarella pearls (or diced fresh mozzarella) to the tomato topping.
- **Balsamic glaze isn’t a low carb condiment** – skip if you’re carb conscious or on a keto diet.
