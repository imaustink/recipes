# Beef & Parmesan Tortellini

## Ingredients

1. 8 oz of steak of choice, sliced
2. 12 oz of cheese tortellini, cooked according to package instructions
3. 2 tablespoons of olive oil
4. 1/2 cup of diced onion
5. 2 cloves of garlic, minced
6. 1 teaspoon of dried basil
7. Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
8. 1/2 cup of milk + 1/2 cup of heavy cream
9. 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese
10. Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish

## Directions

1. **Brown the Steak**: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the steak slices and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the steak is browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove and set aside.
2. **Sauté Aromatics**: In the same skillet, add the diced onion and minced garlic. Cook until the onion is translucent and fragrant, about 3 minutes.
3. **Simmer with Milk and Cream**: Return the browned steak to the skillet. Pour in the mixture of milk and heavy cream and bring to a gentle simmer. Stir in the dried basil and half of the grated Parmesan, simmering until the sauce thickens slightly, about 4-5 minutes.
4. **Combine with Tortellini**: Toss the cooked tortellini into the skillet, mixing thoroughly to coat each piece with the sauce. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste.
5. **Serve Garnished**: Serve the tortellini and beef hot, sprinkled with the remaining Parmesan and fresh parsley.

## Equipment

1. Large skillet
2. Cooking spoon
3. Knife
4. Cutting board
5. Measuring cups and spoons

## Tips

1. **Choosing the Beef**: Opt for your favorite cut of steak. Make sure to slice the steak into even pieces to ensure uniform cooking.
2. **Cooking the Tortellini**: Be sure to cook the tortellini just until al dente, as it will continue to cook slightly when tossed in the sauce. Overcooking can make the tortellini too soft.
3. **Sauce Consistency**: If you prefer a thicker sauce, you can let it simmer a bit longer or add a little extra Parmesan to help it thicken.
