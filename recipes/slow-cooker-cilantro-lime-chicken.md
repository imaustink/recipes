# Slow Cooker Cilantro Lime Chicken

## Ingredients

1. ½ cup chicken broth
2. ¼ cup olive oil
3. Juice of 3-4 limes
4. 4 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
5. 2 teaspoons cumin
6. 1 teaspoon paprika
7. 1 teaspoon kosher salt
8. 1 teaspoon ground pepper
9. 2 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts
10. ½ cup chopped cilantro

## Directions

1. Place the chicken broth, olive oil, lime juice from 3-4 limes, garlic, salt, cumin, paprika, and pepper into a blender. Blend until the garlic is pulverized and the sauce is well incorporated.
2. Lay the chicken in a single layer in the crockpot. Pour the sauce over the chicken.
3. Cover and cook on high for 3-4 hours or low for 5-6 hours, until the chicken is very tender and easily pulls with the tines of a fork.
4. Using two forks, shred the chicken right in the pot. Add the cilantro, then toss until well combined. Serve warm, right away. Enjoy!
