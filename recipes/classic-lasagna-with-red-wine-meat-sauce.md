4. 2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
5. 1/4 tsp nutmeg (optional but traditional)
6. Salt & pepper to taste

### Other Layers

1. 1 lb low moisture mozzarella, shredded
2. Fresh basil, torn (optional but delicious)
3. 12 lasagna noodles, cooked al dente, or no-boil noodles

## Directions

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Make the Red Wine Meat Sauce

1. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat.
2. Add beef and sausage, breaking apart with a spoon. Brown deeply—this adds major flavor.
3. Add onion, carrot, celery, and cook 5–7 minutes until softened.
4. Add garlic and cook until fragrant (30 seconds).
5. Stir in tomato paste and cook 1–2 minutes to caramelize.
6. Pour in the red wine. Scrape up all browned bits.
7. Simmer 3–5 minutes until the wine reduces by about half.
8. Add crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, chili flakes, bay leaf, salt, and pepper.
9. Reduce heat to low and simmer at least 1 hour, ideally 90 minutes to 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
10. Remove bay leaf, taste, adjust seasoning.

#### 2. Prepare the Cheese Filling

Mix together:

- Ricotta
- Egg
- Parmesan
- Parsley
- Nutmeg
- Salt & pepper

Set aside.

#### 3. Cook the Lasagna Noodles

- If using traditional noodles, boil until just al dente (they’ll cook more in the oven).
- If using no-boil noodles, proceed as-is.

#### 4. Assemble the Lasagna

Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).

Layer in a 9×13 pan:

1. Thin layer of sauce
2. Noodles
3. Ricotta mixture (⅓)
4. Mozzarella + a sprinkle of Parmesan
5. Sauce (⅓)

Repeat until you have 3 full layers, ending with:

- Noodles
- Sauce
- Mozzarella + a final dusting of Parmesan

Add torn fresh basil between layers if you like.

#### 5. Bake

1. Cover loosely with foil (tip: spray foil with oil so cheese doesn’t stick).
2. Bake 30 minutes.
3. Remove foil and bake 15–20 minutes until bubbling and browned.
4. Let rest 15–20 minutes before slicing (crucial—keeps it from falling apart).

## Equipment

1. Large pot
2. Spoon for stirring
3. 9×13 baking pan
4. Foil
5. Oven

## Tips

- If the sauce gets too thick, add a splash of water or extra wine.
- Let the lasagna rest for 15–20 minutes before slicing to prevent it from falling apart.
