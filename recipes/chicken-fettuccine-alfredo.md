# Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo

## Ingredients

1. Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
2. 12 ounces fettuccine
3. Olive oil, for tossing
4. 12 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 2)
5. 1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter
6. 1 cup heavy cream
7. 1 cup milk
8. 2 pinches freshly grated nutmeg
9. 1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
10. Garlic powder, to taste

## Directions

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt generously. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente (tender but still slightly firm). Drain and toss with a splash of oil.
2. Meanwhile, slice the chicken into 1/4-inch-thick strips, and lay them on a plate or a sheet of waxed paper. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste.
3. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the butter. When the butter melts, raise the heat to medium-high and add the chicken in 1 layer. Cook, without moving the pieces, until the underside has browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the pieces, and cook until browned and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to a medium bowl.
4. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter. Scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits. When the butter has mostly melted, whisk in the milk, cream, and nutmeg, and bring to a simmer, then cook for 2 minutes. Lower the heat to keep the sauce just warm.
5. Whisk the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the sauce. Add the chicken and cooked pasta and toss well. Season with salt, pepper, and additional garlic powder if desired. Serve hot in heated bowls.

## Equipment

1. Large pot
2. Skillet
3. Wooden spoon
4. Whisk
5. Medium bowl

## Tips

1. Cook the fettuccine al dente. Be sure to remove the pasta from the boiling salted water while it’s still firm. It becomes more tender when you add it to the skillet with the chicken and sauce.
2. Finish the sauce in the skillet. Don’t fret if your alfredo sauce looks thin at first, or if it seems like you have too much of it. When you toss it with the chicken and cooked pasta, the homemade alfredo sauce thickens and clings to the fettuccine—and the entire dish comes together before your eyes.
3. Save some pasta water. The sauce will thicken as it sits, so splash it with a bit of salted pasta water if you want to adjust its consistency.
