# Cinnamon Rolls

## Ingredients

### For the Dough
1. 3/4 cup buttermilk, at room temperature
2. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
3. 1/4 cup granulated sugar
4. 1 large egg, plus 4 large yolks, at room temperature
5. 3 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
6. 1 package rapid rise yeast
7. 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt

### For the Filling and Assembly
1. 1 teaspoon cold unsalted butter, for the pan
2. 1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, for brushing
3. 1 packed cup light brown sugar
4. 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
5. Pinch kosher salt
6. All-purpose flour for rolling

### Updated Frosting (Copycat Cinnabon Frosting)
1. 1 stick softened butter (4 oz)
2. 1/2 pack softened cream cheese (4 oz)
3. 1 cup sifted powdered sugar
4. 1 tsp vanilla extract
5. 1 tsp fresh lemon juice

## Directions

### Make the Dough
1. Combine the buttermilk, butter, sugar, whole egg, and egg yolks in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium speed.
2. As the mixture comes together, add 283 grams (approximately 2 cups) of the flour, along with the yeast and salt, and continue beating until combined.
3. Remove the paddle attachment and replace it with the dough hook. Add another 113 grams (approximately 1 cup) of the remaining flour and knead on low speed for 5 minutes. If the dough is sticky, add more flour, 28 grams (1/4 cup) at a time. Knead on low until the dough clears the sides of the bowl, about another 5 minutes.
4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and form into a smooth ball. Transfer to a large bowl that has been lightly greased with vegetable oil. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside until the dough doubles in volume, about 3 hours.

### Make the Filling and Assemble
1. Butter a 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish with the cold butter. Combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a medium bowl and set aside.
2. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and gently shape into a rectangle with the long side nearest you. Use a rolling pin to shape the dough into an 18-by-12-inch rectangle.
3. Brush the dough with the melted butter, leaving a 1-inch border along the top edge. Sprinkle the brown sugar mixture over the dough, avoiding the top border. Gently press the filling into the dough.
4. Roll the dough into a tight cylinder, starting from the long edge nearest you. Pinch the seam to seal and roll the cylinder seam-side down. Cut the cylinder into 2-inch rolls, yielding 8 pieces.
5. Arrange rolls, cut-side down, in the baking dish; cover tightly with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator overnight, or up to 16 hours.

### To Bake
1. Heat oven to 200°F.
2. When the oven has reached 200°F, turn it off and place the rolls in the turned-off oven. Let the rolls rise until they look slightly puffy, about 30 minutes.
3. Without taking the rolls out of the oven, increase the oven temperature to 350°F and let the rolls continue to bake until the internal temperature reaches 190°F, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the rolls and let cool while you make the icing.

### Make the Updated Frosting
1. Bring the butter and cream cheese to room temperature so that they are soft. Cream together using an electric mixer.
2. Intermittently sift in 1 cup of powdered sugar while beating with the electric mixer. Beat for 10 minutes, or until the frosting is light and fluffy.
3. Add the vanilla and lemon juice and beat until incorporated.

## Equipment

7. Digital kitchen scale

## Tips

For the rolls, if you tend to have hot hands, cover the filling with a layer of plastic wrap before pressing it into the dough. Store any leftover rolls in an airtight container.

For the frosting, if using unsalted butter, add a couple of pinches of salt. Store in the refrigerator but bring to room temperature before serving.
