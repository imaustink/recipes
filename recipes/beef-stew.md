### Beef Stew

#### Ingredients

1. 1 pound beef stew meat, cut into 1½-inch chunks
2. Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
3. 4 tablespoons (½ stick) salted butter
4. 1 white onion, cut into ½-inch dice
5. 4 carrots, peeled and cut into ¼-inch dice
6. 3 celery stalks, cut into ¼-inch dice
7. 5-8 garlic cloves, minced (or garlic paste equivalent)
8. ½ cup all-purpose flour
9. 1 tablespoon garlic powder
10. 1 tablespoon garlic salt
11. One 32-ounce box beef broth
12. One 14.5-ounce can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
13. One 14.4-ounce can gold and white corn, such as Del Monte, undrained
14. 1 large russet potato, scrubbed and cut into ½-inch cubes

#### Directions

1. Lightly season the beef with a pinch each of salt and pepper. In a large soup pot, heat the butter over medium heat until the foam subsides. Add the beef and sauté it until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.
2. Add the onion, carrots, celery, and garlic and sauté until the vegetables are tender but not fully cooked, about 10 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic (or garlic paste) into veggies until aromatic, 1-2 minutes. Stir in the flour, garlic powder, garlic salt, and 1 teaspoon each of kosher salt and pepper. Cook for 1 or 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, until well combined.
3. Add the veggie mix to a crockpot.
4. Add the broth, tomatoes, corn and its liquid, and chopped potato to the crockpot. Add up to 1 cup water if necessary to ensure that the ingredients are covered. Cook on high 3-4 hours or on low 7-8 hours until veggies are at desired tenderness.
5. Ladle the stew into bowls. Serve immediately.
