# Easy Chocolate Mousse

## Ingredients

1. 1 cup Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips
2. 2½ cups heavy whipping cream, divided
3. ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
4. ⅛ teaspoon coarse kosher salt
5. 2 tablespoons powdered sugar

## Directions

1. **Melt the Chocolate**: Add the Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips and ½ cup of heavy whipping cream to a microwave-safe bowl. Place the bowl in the microwave and heat in short 15-second intervals, stirring between each, until the chocolate chips are completely melted.
2. **Stir in the vanilla extract and kosher salt**: Stir until combined, then set the chocolate aside. Allow it to cool slightly, stirring occasionally.
3. **Prepare the whipped cream**: In a large bowl, whip the heavy whipping cream with the powdered sugar with an electric hand mixer until stiff peaks form. Set aside ¾ cup of the whipped cream.
4. **Fold the whipped cream into the melted chocolate**: Gently fold the homemade whipped cream into the prepared (and slightly cooled) chocolate mixture. For best results, use a rubber spatula and avoid over-mixing.
5. **Chill**: For best results, chill in the refrigerator for 2-4 hours or until completely set.
6. **Divide and serve**: Divide the prepared chocolate mousse between four serving dishes and serve as is or with a garnish like additional whipped cream.

## Equipment

2. Electric hand mixer
3. Rubber spatula
4. Serving dishes

## Tips

1. **Use good-quality chocolate**: Always use high-quality chocolate for the best flavor. At the very least, choose a brand and cocoa percentage that you enjoy eating on its own.
2. **Use cold, heavy whipping cream**: When making the whipped cream, use heavy whipping cream that is very cold. It should be straight from the refrigerator.
3. **Melt the chocolate properly**: The chocolate must be melted slowly and gently to prevent it from seizing. Using a double boiler is ideal, but if using a microwave, be patient and do so in short bursts (15-20 seconds), stirring between each to ensure even heating.
4. **Cool the chocolate**: Allow it to cool slightly before mixing the melted chocolate with any other ingredients. This prevents the chocolate from seizing or the whipped cream from deflating due to too much heat.
5. **Fold gently**: Use a gentle folding technique and avoid over-mixing when folding the melted chocolate with the whipped cream.
