# Austin’s Garlic Mac & Cheese

## Ingredients

* 1 box of macaroni noodles
* 1/4 tube of garlic paste (or ~8 cloves of minced garlic)
* 1/2 cube of butter 
* 1 heaping spoonful of flour
* 1 cup of milk
* Johnny’s Garlic Seasoning
* Pepper
* 1 tsp sodium Citrate 
* 8 oz shredded Colby Jack cheese
* 12 oz shredded cheese of choice (extra sharp white cheddar, sharp cheddar, flagship, etc.)
* Dot’s pretzel crumbs
* Parmesan cheese (enough for a thin layer on top)

## Directions

* Preheat oven to 350 degrees
* Cook elbow macaroni noodles 2/3 of the time the box recommends to al dente. Drain and set aside
* In a pot, add butter and garlic paste (or cloves) and let it melt. Cook the garlic down until it is lightly browned and aromatic 
* Add flour and stir well and continue to cook for a couple of minutes on medium heat (until the “flour” taste is cooked out, or approx. 2 mins)
* Add milk (if it thickens too much and becomes hard to store, you can add a bit more milk later)
* Add a generous amount of Johnny’s Garlic seasoning and pepper (“until it looks beautiful”)
* Add sodium citrate, stir well. Then add Colby jack + other cheese of choice handfuls at a time and melt all the cheese into a rue (if it is super thick, you can add a bit more milk)
* Add the cooked noodles into the pot, stir well, then put mixture into a baking dish
* Top dish with a light sprinkle/layer of Dot’s pretzel crumbs, parmesan cheese and Johnny’s garlic seasoning and bake for 30 minutes
