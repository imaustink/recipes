# Oat-Cinnamon Cobbler Topping (Cobbler-Crisp Hybrid)

## Ingredients

1. 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
2. 1/3 cup rolled oats (old-fashioned, not quick oats)
3. 1/4 cup brown sugar
4. 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
5. 1/4 tsp baking powder
6. 1/4 tsp salt
7. 1/4 cup cold butter, cubed
8. 1–2 tbsp milk (as needed to bring it together)

Optional Add-ins:
1. 1/8 tsp nutmeg (for more depth)
2. 1 tbsp chopped pecans or walnuts for extra crunch

## Directions

1. In a medium bowl, combine flour, oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt.
2. Cut in the cold butter until it resembles coarse, crumbly meal.
3. Add milk one tablespoon at a time until the mixture is just moistened enough to clump together.
4. Spoon onto the center of each peach half — don’t worry about covering the entire top; the rustic look is part of the charm.
5. Bake as before (25–30 minutes at 350°F) until golden and bubbling.

## Equipment

1. Medium bowl
2. Spoon
3. Oven

## Tips

For added flavor, consider including the optional nutmeg and nuts. Ensure the butter is cold to achieve the right crumbly texture.
