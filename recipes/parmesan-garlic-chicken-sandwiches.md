# Parmesan Garlic Chicken Sandwiches

## Ingredients

1. 2 chicken breasts
2. 1/2 tsp salt
3. 1/2 tsp pepper
4. 1 tsp onion powder
5. 1 tsp garlic powder
6. 1 tsp paprika
7. Buffalo Wild Wings Parmesan Garlic Sauce
8. 4 buns
9. 2 tbsp butter
10. 8 pieces of cooked bacon
11. Parmesan cheese for topping

## Directions

1. If you don’t have any leftover bacon from breakfast, start by cooking some bacon however you like. Baking it on a sheet pan covered with parchment paper at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes is recommended.
2. Cut 1 lb of chicken breasts to make them thinner.
3. Season the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and smoked paprika on both sides.
4. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat with 1 tbsp of butter and quickly sear the chicken in the skillet on both sides. This won’t fully cook the chicken.
5. Remove the skillet from the heat and brush on some of the Parmesan Garlic Sauce on top of each piece of chicken.
6. Bake in the oven at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F.
7. While the chicken finishes cooking, melt a little bit of butter in a skillet and toast the buns.
8. Top the cooked chicken with shredded Parmesan cheese.
9. Build sandwiches by adding chicken and bacon to the buns.
10. Enjoy!

## Equipment

1. Skillet
2. Oven
3. Baking sheet

## Tips

This recipe makes four sandwiches, but you could easily use more chicken to make as many sandwiches as you need. Serve with air-fried potato wedges or a salad for a complete meal.
