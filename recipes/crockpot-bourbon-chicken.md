# Crockpot Bourbon Chicken

## Ingredients

1. 2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
2. 1/2 cup bourbon whiskey
3. 1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce
4. 1/3 cup brown sugar
5. 1/4 cup ketchup
6. 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
7. 1 tablespoon honey
8. 4 cloves garlic, minced
9. 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
10. 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
11. 2 tablespoons cornstarch
12. 1/4 cup cold water
13. Sliced green onions, for garnish

## Directions

1. Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper and place them in the bottom of a 6-quart slow cooker.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the bourbon, soy sauce, brown sugar, ketchup, vinegar, honey, garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes until well combined. Pour the sauce over the chicken in the slow cooker.
3. Cover and cook on LOW for 6-7 hours or on HIGH for 3-4 hours until the chicken is very tender.
4. Remove the chicken pieces with a slotted spoon and set aside. In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and cold water until smooth. Stir the cornstarch slurry into the sauce in the slow cooker.
5. Cover and cook on HIGH for an additional 20-30 minutes until the sauce is thickened. Add the chicken back into the slow cooker and stir to coat with the sauce.
6. Serve the bourbon chicken over steamed rice and garnish with sliced green onions. Enjoy!

## Tips

1. Choose tender meat: Use boneless, skinless chicken thighs for the most tender and flavorful result.
2. Treat yourself: For the best flavor, choose a good-quality bourbon like Maker's Mark, Bulleit, or Woodford Reserve.
3. Thicken it up: At the end, use a cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce for a glossy, coat-the-spoon consistency.
4. Make it pretty: Top with sliced green onions for a fresh, colorful finish.
5. Spice it up: Adjust the amount of red pepper flakes to suit your desired level of heat.
6. Have fun variations: Add diced onions or bell peppers to the slow cooker for extra flavor and texture.
7. Serve it up right: Serve over steamed rice, quinoa, or cauliflower rice, and pair with a green vegetable like broccoli or green beans.
8. Throw it in the Instant Pot: This recipe can also be made in an Instant Pot. Cook on high pressure for 10 minutes, then thicken the sauce using the sauté function.
